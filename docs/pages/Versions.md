Because the Allie SDK is a client for the Alation REST APIs, you need to make sure the version of Allie SDK you're using is compatible with the version of the Alation that you're using. The Alation REST APIs are versioned and tied directly to the version of the Alation application that you have. To determine what version of the Alation APIs you're using, see [Finding Your Alation Version](https://developer.alation.com/dev/docs/finding-my-alation-version). You can also see what API features are supported for each version by visiting the [Alation developer portal](https://developer.alation.com/dev) and selecting an Alation version.
