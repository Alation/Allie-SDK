## Get the source code and set up a branch

## Code and commit

## Add tests

## Update documentation

Whenever you update existing functionality or add a new feature, you must update the documentation along with your code.

All of the documentation source files can be found in the `/docs` folder on the main branch. Our documentation is written in Markdown (specifically [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/quickref.html)) and built with Jekyll on GitHub Pages. The docs are built automatically anytime a change is made to the main branch.

We use the [Just the Docs](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs) theme. Use the [Just the Docs documentation](https://just-the-docs.com/) for help with formatting, layout, and customization features.

If you are just making documentation updates (adding new docs, fixing typos, improving wording) the easiest method is to use the built-in **Edit this file** feature (the pencil icon) or the **Edit this page** link.

To make more significant changes, create a pull request against the main branch.
