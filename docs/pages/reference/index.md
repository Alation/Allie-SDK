# SDK Reference

The Allie SDK reference is organized by resource. The library is modeled after the REST API. The methods correspond to the endpoints for resources, such as data quality rules and trust check flags. The models have attributes that represent the fields that are in the REST API request and response payloads.

{: .note }
The Allie SDK may be missing some resources and endopints that are currently available in the Alation REST APIs. See the Alation Developer Portal [API Reference](https://developer.alation.com/dev/reference/) for a complete listing of available APIs.
